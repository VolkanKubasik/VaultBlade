# Security Policy

This project is intended for educational, research, and local cryptography workflows.

## Recommendations
- Always use strong passwords or passphrases.
- Never store passwords in plaintext.
- Do not expose private keys or ciphertext metadata publicly without necessity.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date (`pip install --upgrade`).

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you believe you have found a security issue, please report it privately.
No public disclosure without coordinated discussion.
